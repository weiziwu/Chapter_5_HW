# Chapter_5_HW

Last week we started learning about Github. We created a repository online and used the URL to create a local project in R. After making some changes in R, we pushed the new Quarto file or modifications back to Github. It was an interesting exploration of a popular and useful method for storing, sharing, and collaborating on data, methodology and results. I found it informative and exciting to learn!

Thoughts: I find the class content easy to understand. While learning Github might be challenging, it is worth investing time and effort to use it. After the class, I plan to move my dissertation data, research findings, and other important files into a repository.
